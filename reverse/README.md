# reverse image search web service

this is a skeleton reverse image search service built _specifically_ for the main machine learning and color palette analyser mentioned elsewhere in this repository. this **won't work “out of the box”** in your system since it requires the extra [color palette analysis service](https://github.com/dpla/color-summarizer-docker) running (see `COLOR_HOST` variable in `reverse-search.py`). it is trained on the 2300 images mentioned in this repo's main README. 

the idea behind this is to have a pre-trained model (`model.p`) that you can then make searches against. the process is [best explained here](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-guides/blob/master/notebooks/image-search.ipynb). i added a couple additional color-based features (on top of those generated by the convolutional network) to see if i would get better results. i have not validated this thoroughly but thought others might find it useful. it should be relatively easy for anyone with programming knowledge to remove the color palette dependency and just use the “vanilla” convolutional network-based service.

this service loads the model on initial run (takes a few seconds depending on the size of the model) and remains waiting for input.
