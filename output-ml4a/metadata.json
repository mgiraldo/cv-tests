        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

        "The \"Every Girl Pulling for Victory\" World War I poster depicts a woman wearing a navy uniform rowing a small boat named Victory. Below are the words \"Victory Girls,\" and beneath that, \"United War Work Campaign.\" At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the YMCA, YWCA, American Library Association, War Camp Community Service, Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, and Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to “better” sources of entertainment, such as movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. They also secured invitations to local homes, thereby allowing soldiers to meet chaperoned girls of high society. Their goal was to safeguard soldiers from the twin threats of immorality and venereal disease. During World War I, Victory Girls was an organization through which girls collected pennies, nickels, and dimes to support the war effort. However, by World War II, \"Victory Girls\" (comparable to \"Khaki-Wackies\" and \"Good Time Charlottes\") became slang for women who offered soldiers companionship. The illustrator, Edward Penfield (1866-1925), named the father of the American Poster, was a key figure in the evolution of graphic design and is credited for bringing abstractionism to commercial art. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Penfield studied under the well-known painter George de Forest Brush and ultimately became the art director of Harper's Weekly. After leaving the magazine, Penfield traveled, chronicling his experiences in Holland Sketches (1907) and Spanish Sketches (1911).

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

        "A World War I YMCA poster. The poster's foreground contains a banner with a quotation from Raymond Poincare, the president of France during World War I. The quotation states that France will press against its heart the sons who have saved her. Behind the banner is a shield and sword surrounded by laurel leaves. The poster also contains the names of two organizations, Les Foyers du Soldat and L'Union Franco-Americaine, located in the upper left and right hand corners. Les Foyers du Soldat was a French organization that provided relief work to soldiers during the war. L'Union Franco-Americaine consisted of a formal arrangement between the French Army and the YMCA. This organization also serviced soldiers. The YMCA maintained over 1500 canteens in France during the war where members of the military could eat, sleep, bathe and relax. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertising industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work as \"Geo Dorival.\" For a duplicate, see There is another copy of this poster, see http://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15370coll2/id/2101.",

Henderson titled \"The Red Triangle,\" about the YMCA services to American and Allied troops during World War I. The poet, Daniel McIntyre Henderson, was born in Glasgow on July 10, 1851. He wrote a considerable number of poems before moving to the Baltimore, Maryland, but most of them were not preserved. Henderson gave up poetry upon moving, and worked as a bookkeeper with Messrs. R. Renwick & Sons, a furniture manufacturer. Memories of home revived his poetic sensibilities, and in 1874 he wrote \"Flow'rs frae Hame,\" which was set to music by Archibal Johnson. According to the Wisconsin State Work (July 1918, Vol. XXIX, No. 2), a publication of the State Young Men's Christian Association of Wisconsin, \"The National War Work Council of the Y.M.C.A. was so impressed with \"The Road to France,\" the $250 prize poem by Daniel Mclntyre Henderson of South Orange, N.J., that an appeal was made to the National Arts Club to supply posters containing the poem, to be placed in every building of the Y.M.C.A. in this country and in the war zones. 'The Red Triangle' was written by Mr. Henderson to further the present Y.M.C.A. campaign.",

        "Illustration depicts the infamous Golden Madonna basilica in the French town of Albert, located about 75 miles northeast of Paris. The church and the surrounding village are shown in flames, and the Red Cross personnel are displayed evacuating injured civilians. A large winged figure of victory is drawn above the burning basilica, leading an army of French troops into battle. Text reads, \"The Sacred Fire.\" Historical note: The Golden Madonna statue atop the basilica was supposedly discovered by a shepard in the Middle Ages and was believed to have caused several miracles, making it a popular attraction for pilgrims of the 19th century. During World War I, the statue was hit by a German artillery shell, and, as depicted in the poster, it remained nearly horizontal to the ground for most of the war. Superstitions arose amongst soldiers of both sides regarding the meaning of the statue's bend and the effects that toppling the statue would have on the outcome of the war. British troops, fearing that the Germany army would use the basilica's tower as an artillery post, shelled and destroyed the structure in April 1918. The mystical statue was forever lost once the tower collapsed, and after the war, a replica was produced to sit atop the rebuilt basilica, which also serves as World War I museum today.",

        "This World War I poster has a portrait of General J. Pershing and the YMCA Emblem. Beneath is a quote by General Pershing: “A sense of obligation for the varied and useful service rendered to the army in France by the Y.M.C.A. prompts me to join in the appeal for its further financial support. I have opportunity to observe its operations, measure the quality of its personnel and mark its beneficial influence upon our troops, and I wish unreservedly to commend its work for the Army.” This poster was an advertisement for the United War Work Campaign’s fundraiser during the week of November 11, 1918. The YMCA was an integral partner in the United War Work Campaign. United War Work Campaign was created when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"united their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" The seven organizations involved were the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and Salvation Army. With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $170,500,000 during the week of November 11, 1918 (coincidentally the day World War I ended), which they would then divide pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted. This poster was never distributed. John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing (September 13, 1860 – July 15, 1948) was a general officer in the United States Army who led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. Pershing is the only person to be promoted in his own lifetime to the highest rank ever held in the United States Army—General of the Armies (a retroactive Congressional edict passed in 1976 promoted George Washington to the same rank but with higher seniority). Pershing holds the first United States officer service number (O-1). He was regarded as a mentor by the generation of American generals who led the United States Army in Europe during World War II, including George C. Marshall, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar N. Bradley, and George S. Patton. Little is known about S. J. Wauk, the portrait's artist.",

        "“Docks at Bordeaux where Y.M.C.A. Supplies Where Landed.” This illustration depicts the docks at Bordeaux. Bordeaux is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. In the right foreground, a man leans against a wall, speaking to a woman carrying a bundle of flowers. In the left foreground, a woman sells flowers, and three men lean against a wall, surveying the beach and docks. Along the beach, horses pull wagons and people are at work. Docked are a handful of smaller vessels, and behind them is a large steamboat. The French government was moved to the Port of Bordeaux in 1914 when German troops advanced on Paris. At the government’s behest, Marie Curie also took a Bordeaux-bound train, as her lab possessed the county’s entire stock of radium for research. For American soldiers stationed in large cities such as Bordeaux, the YMCA rented houses and hotels to use as canteens. Born in Newton, Massachusetts, Milton Herbert Bancroft (1867 - 1947) was an Impressionist painter of portraits, landscapes, figures, and murals. He attended the Massachusetts Normal Academy School in Boston when he was sixteen, and upon completion of his studies, he began teaching at Swarthmore College. From 1886 to 1893 he took intermittent courses at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts while also teaching there. In 1894, Bancroft married Margaret Moore and move with her to France. His work was influenced by his stay at Giverny, France, where he adopted the effects of sun dappled light on figures and landscape that were espoused by Richard Miller, Louis Ritman, Frederick Frieseke, and George Biddle. He later retired in Sandy Spring, Maryland, where he remained until his death.",
        "The entire right edge is incomplete and the bottom-left corner has withstood damage. There are some darkened areas on the lower half of the poster."

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

When residents of Troy saw the “U.S.” on the barrels, they thought of Uncle Sam, and his name soon became associated with national pride. An unknown artist created this statue during World War I, probably inspired by the famous 1917 “I Want You” recruiting poster."

        "In this World War I poster the top half shows soldiers gathering around a YMCA canteen. Most of the image is circumscribed, with some soldiers standing outside, and behind the circle is the red YMCA triangle. Surrounding the image are the words: \"'The Last Evidence that Anybody Cares,' Says a Soldier 'Overthere' of the Y.M.C.A. dugout.\" The bottom half of the poster contains black text against a green background. It has quotes from soldiers endorsing the importance of the Y.M.C.A. in their lives, followed by a plea for donations to support their $35,000,000 campaign. The bottom right explains where donations can be mailed, while the bottom left lists the numbers of Y.M.C.A. War Work Secretaries, where they are serving, and with which nation's soldiers. For a transcription, see \"text.\" Four days after the United States entered World War One on April 6, 1917, state, local and international YMCA organizations met in conference at Garden City, Long Island, to plan for a unified reaction to the war. The first meeting of the National War Work Council was held in New York on April 28, 1917, where President Wilson gave official recognition to the organization. During November 1917, the YMCA announced their goal of $35,000,000. In defense of the amount, John R. Mott, then YMCA General Secretary, wrote: “Some tasks can wait; not this one of serving 24,000,000 men between now and Spring, the most critical period of the war.” Wilson, Taft, and Roosevelt all publicly endorsed the fundraising which, in 2011 USD, would mean raising close to $607,000,000. Three months after they announced the campaign, they passed their goal, and by July 1918 had raised $54,000,000 (just under $936,000,000 2011 USD).

        "This World War I poster shows the comedy and tragedy theater masks in front of the American and French flags, behind which are oak and laurel leaves. A sword is between the two masks, with a french helmet balanced on its point. Behind the sword is the YMCA red triangle, while in front it reads \"YMCA.\" This image is at the top of a decorative border of bound laurel. The center is empty, and the bottom reads, \"Les Foyers du Soldat,\" \"Union Franco-Americaine.\" This poster was used to announce theatre events at the canteens in France. Masks like Comedy and Tragedy (i.e. Janus masks or Melpomene and Thalia), which have come to stand as symbols of theatre, were used as early as 5 B.C. in Greek theatre, allowing actors to better broadcast their characters' emotions across the amphitheaters and to assume a larger number of roles. General Pershing, in explaining the importance of humanitarian services, said, \"Morale is a state of mind upheld by entertainment.\" In entertaining the American Army: the American stage and lyceum in the World War (1921), James Evans and Gardner Harding explain that when General Pershing asked for entertainers from home to travel overseas, \"the theatrical world stood ready to go to France en masse and now.\" This ferver combined with the army's incredibly strict regulations inspired the creation of The Over There Theatre League, which set up a practical plan for ascertaining the exact requirements of the Army and helped actors to negotiate bureaucratic red tape. The first volunteers for the Over There Theatre League left home on July 31, 1918, and the last on May 15, 1919. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival (1879-1968), trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he was a well-known poster artist for tourism and advertising industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross, the YMCA, and the Women’s Union of France. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work “Geo Dorival.”"

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

Beneath the list it reads, \"United War Work Campaign.\" Below that is their fundraising goal of $170.500.000. The document has a red, white, and blue border, with red circles are each corner containing the white number 170. The United War Work Campaign was started when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"united their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" These organizations included the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council-Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and the Salvation Army. With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $170, 500,000 for the week of November 11, 1918 (coincidentally the day when World War I ended), which they would then divide pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted."

        "This image depicts Baie du bouley (the Bouley Bay), a scenic coast on the northeast corner of Jersey island off the northern coast of France. The image shows trees through which you can see a quiet ocean and rocky coast. At the bottom it reads “LES FOYERS du SOLDAT et du MARIN” (trans: The Home of the Soldier and the Sailor) and “Union Franco-Americaine” (trans: The French American Union). The YMCA emblem is on both bottom corners, near the words “Coquemer imp. paris.” Inscribed in the bottom left corner are the words \"Visa No. 14786.\" The Union Franco-Americaine was a formal arrangement between the American YMCA and the French Army, and Emmanuel Sautter was in charge of the Foyer du Soldat program. In February 1918, the French ministry of war agreed to provide the YMCA with buildings, tables, benches, light, and heat to establish new foyers (the quartermaster general provided necessary supplies and the French army transported them). In return, the American YMCA provided secretaries and programming. By February 1919, they had established 1452 Foyers du Soldat for the French army. They operated at the front and behind the lines, just as American canteens did. At the conclusion of World War I, supreme allied commander Marshal Foch commented on the massive support that was provided by the YMCA during hostilities in an address to YMCA officials and staff: “Thanks to your powerful help we were able to maintain our morale; thanks to the Foyer du Soldat Union Franco-Americaine YMCA, into which the tired soldier came for new strength, and to find a touch of that family life, or at least that familiar contact which seemed to him an infinite comfort. This was the means by which resistance was maintained [and] you sheltered all that work in the shadow of the finest ideals, the principle of humanity - unselfish service.” The illustrator, Constant Duval, was a prolific posterist for railway companies in the 1910s and 1920s.",

The poster shows the continuation of the involvement and good work the YMCA conducted during the first World War. One of the YMCA's many activities to support the war was running 1,500 canteens throughout France. These canteens were places where soldiers could purchase American made goods and have a place to relax and remember home. The YMCA also provided food, books, music, religious instruction, organized choirs and bands to help maintain the body, mind, and spirit of the soldiers as well as all prisoners-of-war.The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertizing industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work as \"Geo Dorival."

Let a factory close down through foolish agitation, or strife, and many of your fellow citizens are thrown out of jobs. The loss in production of the commodities made in your neighborhood will likewise affect the welfare, comfort or convenience of other fellow Americans in remote or nearby districts. Every time the wage-earners of your town are thrown out of work, the grocer, butcher, shoe dealer, clothier, church and lodge suffer, as well as the immediate dependents of the unemployed. Surely your community faces a serious responsibility in dealing with its factories - a responsibility that goes into the home every day in the year. See to it that your home town industries are not overburdened by unfair laws, political horseplay, unjust or excessive taxation, or wasteful friction. THIS IS THE REAL KEYNOTE OF PROSPERITY TOWN."

        "“Verdun Road to Y.M.C.A. Canteen.” World War I poster. The poster shows a soldier on horseback riding under an arch. Two soldiers riding in a motorcycle are heading the other direction. In the foreground, rubble litters the street. On the bottom it reads “Sketched on spot by Y.M.C.A. secy.,” with the YMCA emblem in the left and right bottom corners. It is not sure whether this poster was sketched by a YMCA secretary and if so which secretary this might have been. The poster bears a striking resemblance to a Daniel Putnam Brinley sketch titled Ruines de Guerre: Ligne Hindenburg, Soissons, Verdun, Arras, but it is not known if the poster is based on this drawing or whether he created the artwork for this poster. During World War I, America depended on posters for mass communication as they never had or would again. The artists who produced these posters typically worked for free. The chaplain of the forces in Verdun wrote that “the work of the Y. M. C. A. man was always with us. . . contributing immeasurable to make life worth living under circumstances well nigh impossible.” While there are accounts of secretaries injured or killed, some accounts of soldiers dispute their presence at the front line. When the United States entered World War I, the YMCA became involved running the military canteens (today called post exchanges) in the United States and France. YMCAs took on war relief for both refugees and prisoners of war on both sides, and worked to ease the path of African American soldiers returning to the segregated South among many other tasks.",

        "During World War I, posters seemed to promise a fast, efficient medium for communicating with the home front, and painters, cartoonists, and illustrators volunteered their artistic talents as a patriotic gesture. California artist K. M. Bara's You Are Wanted by U.S. Army recruiting poster depicted General John J. Pershing, the renowned commander of the American Expeditionary Force. Because of two famous advertising campaigns-Uncle Sam's \"I Want You for the U.S. Army\" and Lord Kitchener's \"Your Country Needs You\" in England-the pointing or outstretched hand became a frequent motif for poster propaganda during the war. In addition to that exhorting gesture, Bara used bold coloring and a lively composition of crossing diagonals with the upward-charging horse and the twisting figure. For those who missed the reference to a famous equestrian portrait-Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David-Pershing's recognizable figure was authoritative all on its own."

        "\"Painting from the Saturday Evening Post.\"; \"Additional copies may be obtained upon request from the Division of Public Inquiries, Office of War Information, Washington, D.C.\"; \"U.S. Government Printing Office.\"; \"1943-O-510256.\"; The poster depicts men and women of various races and faiths, including a woman with rosary beads, with hands clasped in prayer.; Norman Rockwell was a 20th-century American painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine for more than four decades. The Four Freedoms or Four Essential Human Freedoms is a series of four oil paintings that Rockwell produced in 1943 for reproduction in The Saturday Evening Post alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. Later they were the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Saturday Evening Post and the United States Department of the Treasury. The Four Freedoms theme was derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt in which he identified four essential human rights (Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear) that should be universally protected. The Office of War Information printed four million sets of Four Freedoms posters by the end of the war.; World War II was a massive conflict which involved a majority of the nations of the world, and became the most widespread and deadliest event in human history; it had profound ramifications politically and economically that lasted into the next century. Armed conflict broke out in 1939, resulting primarily from issues and tensions not resolved by World War I, and spurred by desires of expansion; the aggressive Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan, were opposed by the Allies, including France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States, although dozens of countries participated. Gradually, the Allies asserted control, and victory in Europe was declared 8 May 1945, followed by victory over Japan in the Pacific theatre 2 September. In addition to the loss of life among troops, civilian casualties numbered in the millions. Posters were used extensively throughout the war by countries on both sides for purposes such as propaganda, morale, and the broad dissemination of information.; The United States Office of War Information (OWI) was a U.S. government agency created during World War II to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and, using posters and radio broadcasts, worked to promote patriotism, warn about foreign spies and recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch, which launched a large scale information and propaganda campaign abroad.; The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. More than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million."

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

        "\"Painting from The Saturday Evening Post.\"; \"Additional copies may be obtained upon request from the Division of Public Inquiries, Office of War Information, Washington, D.C.\"; \"U.S. Government Printing Office.\"; \"1943-O-511886.\"; The poster depicts a woman tucking two sleeping children into bed while a man looks on, holding a Bennington, Vermont, newspaper with headlines of war.; Norman Rockwell was a 20th-century American painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine for more than four decades. The Four Freedoms or Four Essential Human Freedoms is a series of four oil paintings that Rockwell produced in 1943 for reproduction in The Saturday Evening Post alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. Later they were the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Saturday Evening Post and the United States Department of the Treasury. The Four Freedoms theme was derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt in which he identified four essential human rights (Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear) that should be universally protected. The Office of War Information printed four million sets of Four Freedoms posters by the end of the war.; World War II was a massive conflict which involved a majority of the nations of the world, and became the most widespread and deadliest event in human history; it had profound ramifications politically and economically that lasted into the next century. Armed conflict broke out in 1939, resulting primarily from issues and tensions not resolved by World War I, and spurred by desires of expansion; the aggressive Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan, were opposed by the Allies, including France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States, although dozens of countries participated. Gradually, the Allies asserted control, and victory in Europe was declared 8 May 1945, followed by victory over Japan in the Pacific theatre 2 September. In addition to the loss of life among troops, civilian casualties numbered in the millions. Posters were used extensively throughout the war by countries on both sides for purposes such as propaganda, morale, and the broad dissemination of information.; The United States Office of War Information (OWI) was a U.S. government agency created during World War II to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and, using posters and radio broadcasts, worked to promote patriotism, warn about foreign spies and recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch, which launched a large scale information and propaganda campaign abroad.; The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. More than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million."

Think of the colonel of a Yankee regiment who led his boys into the attack, and who, when he found one of them in trouble with his machine gun, fixed it and fired it with his own hands. Think of the sergeant who dropped as his platoon was rushing a deadly woods. He called out as he died: \"They've got me, boys! Go on and give 'em hell!\" Think of the Signal Corps men crouching low while the shells tore down their telephone wires, and rushing out to repair them while the shelling was still at its height. Think of little Corporal Jerry--submitting with ill-concealed impatience while his pal from the Hospital Corps dressed a wound in his forehead. He was bandaged so that all you could see of his head was half of his left eye and he was put down by the roadside to wait his turn back in the ambulance. A moment later a lieutenant caught him stealing away, rifle in hand. \"Just ten minutes,\" he begged, \"just ten minutes. I haven't killed one yet and I must. Just ten minutes.\" Think of another wounded man who escaped from the dressing station and was later found unconscious on the road. It was the road leading into the battle. Think of the doughboy found dead on the battlefield of the Marne. who scrawled \"For God and country\" on his gas mask before he died.

The poster reads, “One of the thousand Y.M.C.A. girls in France – United War Work Campaign Nov. 11th to 18th.” The YMCA was an integral partner in the United War Work Campaign, which was started when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"united their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" The seven organizations involved were the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and Salvation Army. With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $170,500,000 during the week of November 11, 1918 (coincidentally the day World War I ended), which they would then divide pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted. There appears to be an artist's signature in the right corner, but it is illegible.",

Illustration depicts Marianne, the female personification of the French Revolution and Republic, holding a sword and standing in front of the French flag and a laurel wreath. Text reads, \"Buy a Sword and a Flag.\" Historical note: 14 July 1789 marks the day that the Parisian mob attacked and captured the Bastille, a fortress used primarily to house political prisoners in the 17th and 18th centuries. This act quickly came to be seen as a symbol for the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the Republic, and it is thus celebrated as Bastille Day, a national holiday, every 14 July.",

There is a bridge broken halfway across the canal, likely depicting the famous West Bridge destroyed by the French to prevent the German army from crossing. The Battle of Château-Thierry, fought on July 18, 1918, was one of the first actions of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John J. Pershing. Prompted by the July 15 German offensive, the American and French forces launched a counter-assault on a 25 mile wide front; the American influence was heaviest in the regions around Chateau-Thierry. The West Bridge was where the French and American troops made their stand after holding the northern banks of the Marne. The attack took the German army by surprise and turned the tide of the war.",

In the background are soldiers marching and an American flag. Beneath the picture are the words, “United Behind the Service Star – United War Work Campaign.” The emblems for the seven organizations line the bottom: the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and Salvation Army. The United War Work Campaign was started when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"united their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $170,500,000 during the week of November 11, 1918 (coincidentally the day World War I ended), which they would then divide pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted. The poster’s artist, Ernest Hamlin Baker, was born in 1889 in Rhode Island. He was a self-taught illustrator who produced over three hundred covers for Time magazine during his seventeen-year tenure with them. He was also responsible for eleven covers for Fortune Magazine between 1929 and 1941. Baker became involved in Works Progress Association (WPA) programs during the 1930s.",

        "A World War I poster, titled “Les Foyers du Soldat” (trans: A Home for Soldiers). On the right is the silhouette of a soldier walking across snowy hills on a starry night toward three buildings that are probably YMCA canteens. The YMCA emblem is in the bottom right corner. The Union Franco-Americaine was a formal arrangement between the American YMCA and the French Army, lead by Emmanuel Sautter. In February 1918, the French ministry of war agreed to provide the YMCA with buildings, tables, benches, light, and heat in order to establish new foyers. In return, the American YMCA provided secretaries and programming. By February 1919, they had established 1,452 Foyers du Soldat for the French Army. They operated at the front and behind the lines, just as American canteens did. At the conclusion of World War I, supreme allied commander Marshal Foch commented on the massive support that was provided by the YMCA during hostilities in an address to YMCA officials and staff: “Thanks to your powerful help, we were able to maintain our morale; thanks to the Foyer du Soldat Franco-Americaine YMCA, into which the tired solder came for new strength and to find a touch of that family life, or at least that familiar contact which seemed to him an infinite comfort. This was the means by which resistance was [and] you sheltered all that work in the shadow of the finest ideals, the principle of humanity––unselfish service.” The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival (1879-1968), trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he was a well-known poster artist for tourism and advertising industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross, the YMCA, and the Women’s Union of France. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work “Geo Dorival.”",
        "There are a few tears along the bottom and a longer tear on the left side. There are two small black stains on the soldier."

        "Two classical columns frame the words: \"Le Foyer du Soldat est le trait d'union entre la ligne de bataille et la vision de la paix qui rendra les foyers familiaux Il aide a combattre a vivre, a esperer\" on this World War I poster. The quote is attributed to General Malleterre, war critic for Paris Temps (1858-1923). Under his name is the YMCA emblem along with the words, \"Les Foyers du Soldat\" and \"Union Franco-Americaine.\" The bottom of the poster reads \"coquemer imp. paris\" and \"Visa No. 13021.\" The architrave is heavily decorated with a laurel and oak leaf wreath, patriotic ribbons, and the French and American flags. The left capital has the United States' national emblem, while the right has France's national emblem. Rising from behind each emblem are the flags of the Allied Nations, including Great Britain, China, Portugal, Greece, Serbia, Belguim, Italy, Montenegro, Cuba, Brazil, and Japan. The artist is unknown. Les Foyers du Soldat set up canteens for soldiers to go to while on leave, providing a place to sleep, relax, and eat. General Malleterre published the article \"How Battles are Fought Today\" in Harper's Magazine (October, 1917) and the article \"How the War Was Won\" in Harper's 1920 Pictorial Library of The World War. In an excerpt of a letter from the front, he writes, \"An armistice [. . .] even with the obligation to evacuate invaded territory and Alsace-Lorraine, would allow the German command to withdraw its armies in security to a distance sufficient to give time to reform the ranks in preparation for the moment when Berlin would denounce the allies' conditions as impossible\" (Spokesman Review, 10-10-1918).",

        "This poster advertises three emergency courses offered by the International YMCA College, now called Springfield College, during World War I: the army work course, the boys’ work course, and the county work course. These courses, which took place between January and July 1918, were meant to prepare men for work that aided the nation’s war effort. Geared toward secretaries, physical directors, and educational directors, the army work course prepared students for Normal Work among troops. The boys’ work course was meant for secretaries, boy scouts, and playground leaders, and it prepared them to work with boys forced into industry (the Fair Labor Standards Act did not pass until after World War I) and those suffering in warring countries. The final course prepared men for county work, which involved food conservation and the supervision of boys and farm workers. Springfield College first began offering these courses in 1917. The poster’s text is printed across an inverted red triangle, the school’s emblem. Along the top of the poster is a photograph of the students who completed the first army work course, which lasted from June to July 1917. In the lower right is a picture of the first county work course, which took place from July to August 1917. The final image, placed along the lower left side of the poster, shows an illustration of a boy crying next to a portrait of Carl B. Kern (class of 1907), an alumnus who was killed on June 3, 1917 “while engaged in an act of service.” Above the boy is the caption, “Every kid in town wuz friends to C.B.” After Kern's death, an endowment was established in his name at The Dayton Foundation."

        "In this World War I poster an older man in a Knights of Columbus uniform gestures at the back of a solider who brings up the end of a line of troops. The group marches toward a horizon marked by clouds from explosions and gunfire. Above the image are the words \"See Him Through,\" while below it reads, \"Help Us To Help The Boys,\" \"National Catholic War Council,\" \"Knights of Columbus,\" and \"United War Work Campaign - Week of November 11-1918.\" Toward the bottom left of the image is the National Catholic War Council emblem, while to the right is the Burton Rice's signature. American Art News (VOL. XVII, No. 7, November 23, 1918), in a critique of then-recent World War I posters, described Rice's poster as \"weakened by too much background of white paper.\" The poster advertises a major fundraising drive that the United War Work Campaign (a coalition of organizations including the Knights of Columbus) underwent. Similar to YMCA work, the Knights of Columbus provided recreation, a place for Catholics to practice their faith, and the amenities of home to soldiers. During World War I, Supreme Knight James A. Flaherty proposed to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The Order raised more than $14 million for this program on its own, and was allocated another $30 million from a national fund drive.

        "This poster advertises the YMCA Army Work Course offered at the International YMCA College, now called Springfield College. The army work intensive training course lasted one month and was one of three offered by the college throughout World War I. This poster advertises the fourth and fifth terms, held between October and December 1917. Behind the bulk of the writing is an inverted red triangle, the college’s emblem. At the top of the poster is a photograph of the students in Springfield College’s first army work course, which ran from June 16 to July 13, 1917. Lake Massasoit is visible behind the men. The bottom of the poster lists the men who served on the Committee on Army Work Course and advises interested persons to contact Arthur Rudman, the director of the army work course and a faculty member at the college. The bulk of the writing states that students will “have opportunities for Normal Practice” among “the troops at the United States Arsenal” and those stationed nearby at Camp Bartlett. The class covered a variety of subjects, such as educational work, religious work, social work, the history and organization of the army, YMCA history, and games “suitable for Army camp life.” Daily instruction was offered in the French and Russian languages. Springfield College was chosen as a training agency to prepare and equip men for war work during World War I. Although many of faculty members served in the War Work Group which oversaw the operation, Arthur Rudman was the director."

Her screen popularity from such films as Tess of the Storm Country (1914) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) made her \"America's sweetheart,\" but she was also a shrewd businesswoman who cofounded United Artists (1919) and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (1927).",
        "Born Gladys Smith in Toronto, she came to the United States with her family in 1901. She worked with Broadway impresario David Belasco-who changed her name to Mary Pickford-and also began appearing in movies. From 1913 to 1919, she was the leading female star of silent films.",
        "Pickford led the Hollywood war effort during World War I, selling bonds and making such films as Johanna Enlists (1918). An honorary colonel, she exhorted departing troops: \"Don't come back ?til you've taken the germ out of Germany!"

All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onward with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp.

Believing that people would respond to the parade’s symbolism and spectacle, she rode as its herald. Her strong and feminine figure symbolically led the way to a brighter future for women. Milholland suffered from pernicious anemia, she had been warned by doctors that constant vigorous campaigning would be dangerous to her health but disregarded their concerns to further promote the cause. She collapsed and died in 1916 while traveling to promote woman suffrage. She became the martyred heroine of the movement, forever remembered as the 1913 parade’s inspiring herald.",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

        "\"Painting from the Saturday Evening Post.\"; \"Additional copies may be obtained upon request from the Division of Public Inquiries, Office of War Information, Washington, D.C.\"; \"U.S. Government Printing Office.\"; \"1943-O-510257.\"; The poster depicts a man in short outer jacket and zippered flannel work shirt standing to voice an opinion at a Vermont town meeting, while men in suits and a woman listen.; Norman Rockwell was a 20th-century American painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine for more than four decades. The Four Freedoms or Four Essential Human Freedoms is a series of four oil paintings that Rockwell produced in 1943 for reproduction in The Saturday Evening Post alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. Later they were the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Saturday Evening Post and the United States Department of the Treasury. The Four Freedoms theme was derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt in which he identified four essential human rights (Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear) that should be universally protected. The Office of War Information printed four million sets of Four Freedoms posters by the end of the war.; World War II was a massive conflict which involved a majority of the nations of the world, and became the most widespread and deadliest event in human history; it had profound ramifications politically and economically that lasted into the next century. Armed conflict broke out in 1939, resulting primarily from issues and tensions not resolved by World War I, and spurred by desires of expansion; the aggressive Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan, were opposed by the Allies, including France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States, although dozens of countries participated. Gradually, the Allies asserted control, and victory in Europe was declared 8 May 1945, followed by victory over Japan in the Pacific theatre 2 September. In addition to the loss of life among troops, civilian casualties numbered in the millions. Posters were used extensively throughout the war by countries on both sides for purposes such as propaganda, morale, and the broad dissemination of information.; The United States Office of War Information (OWI) was a U.S. government agency created during World War II to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and, using posters and radio broadcasts, worked to promote patriotism, warn about foreign spies and recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch, which launched a large scale information and propaganda campaign abroad.; The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. More than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million."

As in World War I, Congress found it necessary to instate the draft, as posters and other incentives were not enough to entice enlistees.",

Recruiting as an activity of the military is important to the understanding of who serves in uniform, during both warand peac, and the visual materials used to market military service.",
        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism, and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war.",

All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onward with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp. The original envelope which contained the stamps reads: \"Oorlog-Sluitzegels naar ontwepren van Lodewijk Schelfhout: verpakt onder het merk: Posta: Wittig Gedeponeerd: Serie van 6 stuks 10 cent.",

The doors are held open by two figures and everything inside is warmly lit against the backdrop of the snowy winter night. The head of the sheet has the emblems for both the Y.M.C.A and the Y.W.C.A. on either side of the text \"His Home Over There.\" The bottom reads: \"More than 2000 Such Homes for Our Boys; United War Work Campaign; November 11th-18th.\" At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the American Library Association, the War Camp Community Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, and the Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. As part of its humanitarian relief work during World War I, the Y.M.C.A. even owned forty-four factories in Europe dedicated to the production of cookies and candy for the troops. Concerned in particular about young women in the communities adjacent to army camps, the Y.W.C.A. recruited and trained speakers who delivered over 2,000 lectures between 1917 and 1918. Y.W.C.A workers established centers “to help keep women fit for their work” by providing opportunities for rest, relaxation, and a good meal at a reasonable price. The artist, Albert Herter, (1871-1950) was born in New York. Herter was the original owner of the Creeks, an extravagant 60-acre estate on Georgica Pond. He married fellow-artist McGinnis, and their son, Christian Herter, became Dwight D. Eisenhower’s second Secretary of State. Herter studied in Paris, and some of his most well-known works include Young Girl, Garden of the Hesperides, and Still Life with Flowering Dogwood and Japanese Figurines.",

Other significant features of the poster include a sunken boat, indicating the destruction caused by the invading German armies, and a large windmill. Text reads, \"Belgian Canal Boat Fund: For Relief of the Civil Population behind the firing lines. Send them Something.\" Historical note: The Belgian Canal Boat Fund was founded in December 1914 by Agar Adamson and Kathryn Innis-Taylor, two Canadian women living in London during World War I. The fund was created to raise money for food, clothing, and medical aid for Belgian citizens and soldiers trapped behind the firing lines, and the founders hoped to deliver these supplies via the Belgian canal network. Ultimately, this plan proved impossible. Mabel Adamson commissioned John Hassall to create this poster hoping that its haunting image would attract civilian support for the fund.",

The top left corner has the YMCA emblem. The left half of the middle third is a yellow box asking for donations and listing the costs of YMCA services. The right half of the center third contains the text “Always at the Service of our Brave Troops” and a few paragraphs about donations (see text: “If our boys, tired and mud-stained...”). The left side of the bottom third shows a picture of soldiers relaxing in a YMCA canteen. The right side of the bottom third states at what address the public can send their donations. The YMCA announced their goal of $35,000,000 November, 1917. In defense of the amount, John R. Mott, then YMCA General Secretary, wrote: “Some tasks can wait; not this one of serving 24,000,000 men between now and Spring, the most critical period of the war.” Wilson, Taft, and Roosevelt all publicly endorsed the fundraising which, in 2011 USD, would mean raising close to $607,000,000. Three months after they announced the campaign, they passed their goal, and by July 1918 had raised $54,000,000 (just under $936,000,000 2011 USD).",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

        "Text and etching of balloon from which acrobats dangle; red, blue and black ink on paper lined with linen. The poster is composed of three separate elements. The balloon and basket was created by lithographer Vadot. The colored background was created by a poster-maker in Paris. As the Godards moved around Europe, local poster makers created exhibition-specific, detailed posters and used the Vadot lithograph to advertise the Godards. The acrobats in this poster are from another source, and the type and bands of color are unique to this particular exhibition.",
        "Fireworks, games, dances, foot races and more were typical fare at 19th century festivals like the Fête des L’Oeuvre des Loyers held on Sunday July 4, 1886 in northwestern Paris. Small typeface announces these expected diversions and, surprisingly, the intended display of new inventions like battery powered lighting and telephones as well. In contrast, the larger scale illustrations of Louis Godard’s hot air balloon and dangling trapeze artists, even though stock images, make a striking and compelling focal point for the poster. The red stripe of the Tricolor-inspired design further emphasizes ballooning as the fair’s main attraction.",
        "Letterpress companies designing posters in the late 19th century, especially in France, often used independently-made pictures to strengthen the visual impact of the variable typeface that characterized their posters. The Godard poster, however, inverts the usual formula of the mixed-media image, using color stripes to create a hierarchy of text and black and white images for punch. This advertisement would have been an exception amidst the hoardings’ posters, most of which relied on color lithography to add a three dimensional and eye-catching element.",
        "The balloon and trapeze artist images are generic except for the addition of Louis Godard’s name to the balloon. Unlike Jules Chéret’s specific portraits that graced his circus posters or Toulouse Lautrec’s lithographs of well-known cabaret performers, Godard’s face was unnecessary for selling the product. Louis Godard was part of a “veritable dynasty” of aeronauts who performed prolifically in the late nineteenth century. Louis’ brother Eugene Godard first flew a Montgolfier balloon in 1847, and began to perform regular ascensions at the Paris Hippodrome by 1850. When demand for his performances became too much for him to handle on his own, he enlisted and taught his father, uncle, his brothers Louis, Jules and Auguste, his sister and eventually six of his cousins in the fine art of ballooning.",
        "The allure of the balloon, even though more than 100 years old by the time of the 1886 fair in the Square des Batignolles, prevailed. During the 1890s, however, the nexus of balloon ascensions, pleasure gardens, trapeze acts, fireworks and public demonstrations of new inventions was disintegrating. Ironically, at the same time ballooning was losing its popular appeal, young men of the monied class began to purchase balloons and learn to pilot them. Louis Godard and partner Gabriel Yon profited greatly from this shift in clientele, provisioning well-to-do amateur balloonists from their factory on the Champs de Mars until the beginning of World War I.",
        "The Birth of Flight: NASM Collections",
        "The invention of the balloon struck the men and women of the late 18th century like a thunderbolt. Enormous crowds gathered in Paris to watch one balloon after another rise above the city rooftops, carrying the first human beings into the air in the closing months of 1783. The excitement quickly spread to other European cities where the first generation of aeronauts demonstrated the wonder of flight. Everywhere the reaction was the same. In an age when men and women could fly, what other wonders might they achieve.",
        "Among all our circle of friends,\" one observer noted, \"at all our meals, in the antechambers of our lovely women, as in the academic schools, all one hears is talk of experiments, atmospheric air, inflammable gas, flying cars, journeys in the sky.\" Single sheet prints illustrating the great events and personalities in the early history of ballooning were produced and sold across Europe. The balloon sparked new fashion trends and inspired new fads and products. Hair and clothing styles, jewelry, snuffboxes, wallpaper, chandeliers, bird cages, fans, clocks, chairs, armoires, hats, and other items, were designed with balloon motifs.",
        "Thanks to the generosity of several generations of donors, the National Air and Space Museum maintains one of the world's great collections of objects and images documenting and celebrating the invention and early history of the balloon. Visitors to the NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles International Airport can see several display cases filled with the riches of this collection. We are pleased to provide visitors to our web site with access to an even broader range of images and objects from this period. We invite you to share at least a small taste of the excitement experienced by those who witness the birth of the air age.",

        "The NASM Collection of Objects Related to Early Ballooning",
        "The invention of the balloon struck the men and women of the late 18th century like a thunderbolt. The Montgolfier brothers, Joseph-Michel (August 26, 1740-June 26, 1810) and Jacques Etienne (January 6, 1745 - August 2, 1799), launched the air age when they flew a hot air balloon from the town square of Annonay, France, on June 4, 1783. Members of a family that had been manufacturing paper in the Ardèche region of France for generations, the Montgolfiers were inspired by recent discoveries relating to the composition of the atmosphere. Joseph led the way, building and flying his first small hot air balloons late in 1782, before enlisting his brother in the enterprise.",
        "Impatient for the Montgolfiers to demonstrate their balloon in Paris, Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, a pioneering geologist and member of the Académie Royale, sold tickets to a promised ascension and turned the money over to Jacques Alexandre-César Charles (1746-1823), a chemical experimenter whom he had selected to handle the design, construction and launch of a balloon. Charles flew the first small hydrogen balloon from the Champs de Mars, near the present site of the Eiffel Tower, on August 27, 1783. Not to be outdone, the Montgolfiers sent the first living creatures (a sheep, a duck and a rooster) aloft from Versailles on September 19.",
        "Pilatre de Rozier, a scientific experimenter, and François Laurent, the marquis D'Arlandes, became the first human beings to make a free flight on November 21. Less than two weeks later, on December 1, 1783, J.A. C. Charles and M.N. Robert made the first free flight aboard a hydrogen balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries.",
        "A wave of excitement swept across Paris as the gaily decorated balloons rose, one after another, over the skyline of the city. Throughout the summer and fall of 1783 the crowds gathering to witness the ascents grew ever larger. As many as 400,000 people - literally half of the population of Paris--gathered in the narrow streets around the Château des Tuileries to watch Charles and Robert disappear into the heavens.",
        "The wealthy and fashionable set purchased tickets of admission to the circular enclosure surrounding the launch site. Guards had a difficult time restraining the crush of citizens swarming the nearby streets, and crowding the Place de Louis XV (now the Place de la Concorde) and the garden walkways leading toward the balloon. People climbed walls and clambered out of windows onto roofs in search of good vantage points.",
        "It is impossible to describe that moment:\" wrote one observer of a balloon launch, \"the women in tears, the common people raising their hands to the sky in deep silence; the passengers leaning out of the gallery, waving and crying out in joy… the feeling of fright gives way to wonder.\" One group of spectators greeted a party of returning aeronauts with the question: \"Are you men or Gods?\" In an age when human beings could fly, what other wonders might the future hold?",
        "The balloons had an enormous social impact. The huge, seething crowds were something new under the sun. The spectators who gathered in such huge numbers were just becoming accustomed to the idea of change. The old certainties of their grandparent's world were giving way to an expectation that the twin enterprises of science and technology would provide the foundation for \"progress.",
        "The balloons sparked new fashion trends and inspired new fads and products. Hair and clothing styles, jewelry, snuffboxes, wallpaper, chandeliers, bird cages, fans, clocks, chairs, armoires, hats, and other items, were designed with balloon motifs. Party guests sipped Créme de l' Aérostatique liqueur and danced the Contredanse de Gonesse in honor of the Charles globe.",
        "The Americans who were living in Paris to negotiate a successful conclusion to the American revolution were especially fascinated by the balloons. It seemed only fitting that, at a time when their countrymen were launching a new nation, human beings were throwing off the tyranny of gravity. The oldest and youngest members of the diplomatic community were the most seriously infected with \"balloonamania.",
        "All conversation here at present turns upon the Balloons…and the means of managing them so as to give Men the Advantage of Flying,\" Benjamin Franklin informed an English friend, Richard Price. Baron Grimm, another Franklin acquaintance, concurred. \"Among all our circle of friends,\" he wrote, \"at all our meals, in the antechambers of our lovely women, as in the academic schools, all one hears is talk of experiments, atmospheric air, inflammable gas, flying cars, journeys in the sky.",
        "Franklin noted that small balloons, made of scraped animal membranes, were sold \"everyday in every quarter.\" He was invited to visit a friend's home for \"tea and balloons,\" and attended a fête at which the duc de Chartres distributed \"little phaloid balloonlets\" to his guests. At another memorable entertainment staged by the duc de Crillon, Franklin witnessed the launch of a hydrogen balloon some five feet in diameter that kept a lantern aloft for over eleven hours.",
        "The senior American diplomat in Paris purchased one of the small balloons as a present for his grandson and secretary, William Temple Franklin. Released in a bed chamber, \"it went up to the ceiling and remained rolling around there for some time.\" Franklin emptied the membrane of hydrogen and forwarded it to Richard Price so that he and Sir Joseph Banks might repeat the experiment. The delightful little toy was thus not only the first balloon to be owned by an American but also the first to reach England. Both Franklins were soon supplying little balloons to friends across Europe.",
        "Sixteen year old John Quincy Adams also took note of the small balloons offered for sale by street vendors. \"The flying globes are still very much in vogue,\" he wrote on September 22. \"They have advertised a small one of eight inches in diameter at 6 livres apiece without air [hydrogen] and 8 livres with it. .. Several accidents have happened to persons who have attempted to make inflammable air, which is a dangerous operation, so that the government has prohibited them.",
        "There was a general sense that the colorful globes marked the beginning of a new age in which science and technology would effect startling change. The results and the implications of the revolution in physics and chemistry underway for over a century were largely unknown outside an elite circle of privileged cognoscenti. The balloon was unmistakable proof that a deeper understanding of nature could produce what looked very much like a miracle. What else was one to think of a contrivance that would carry people into the sky?",
        "If human beings could break the age-old chains of gravity, what other restraints might they cast off? The invention of the balloon seemed perfectly calculated to celebrate the birth of a new nation dedicated, on paper at any rate, to the very idea of freedom for the individual. In the decade to come the balloons and the men and women who flew them came to symbolize the new political winds that were blowing through France. While some might question the utility of the \"air globes,\" flight was already reshaping the way in which men and women regarded themselves and their world.",
        "Of course most citizens of Europe and America were unable to travel to see a balloon. They had their first glimpse of the aerial craft through the medium of single sheet prints. In the late 18th century it was difficult and expensive to publish anything more than the roughest of woodcuts in newspapers or magazines. In an effort to share the excitement with those who could not attend an ascent, to let people know what a balloon looked like, and to introduce the brave men and women who were taking to the sky, artists, engravers and publishers flooded the market with scores of single sheet printed images. Ranging from the meticulously accurate to the wildly fanciful, these printed pictures were sold by the thousands in print shops across Europe.",
        "The business of producing and marketing such images was nothing new. In Europe, block prints from woodcuts had been used to produce book illustrations and single sheet devotional or instructional religious images since the mid-15th century. In the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, the technique was used to produce multi-sheet maps, bird's eye images of cities, and other products. In the early modern era, etching and engraving techniques enabled artists from Albrecht Dürer to Rembrandt van Rijn the opportunity to market copies of their paintings. .",
        "In the 1730's. William Hogarth inaugurated a new era in the history of English printed pictures when he published his, \"Harlot's Progress,\" a series of single sheet images charting the downfall of a young woman newly arrived in London. Other sets, including \"Marriage à la Mode,\" appeared in the decade that followed. Other artists used the medium of the etching or engraving to reproduce portraits and offer examples of their work for sale.",
        "By the late 18th century, Thomas Rowlandson, James Gillray and other English artists made considerable fortunes producing sporting prints and satirical images offering biting commentary on the shortcomings of the political and social leaders of the day. Rowlandson was said to have \"etched as much copper as would sheathe the British navy.\" In order to publish his prints and caricatures while they were still newsworthy, Rowlandson worked rapidly. He would water color the first impression, then send it to refugee French artists employed by Rudolph Ackermann, one of his favored publishers, who would color each of the prints before they were hung up in the shop window. In the 1780's a typical print seems to have sold for a shilling, the price being sometimes included on the print itself.",
        "The appearance of the balloon in 1783 provided artists, engravers and publishers in England, France, Germany and Italy a new subject for their efforts. As the wave of balloon enthusiasm swept across the continent, the production and sale of images depicting the great flights and daring aeronauts flourished. In addition to illustrating the birth of the air age, print makers made use of balloon motifs in comic images satirizing political events or social trends.",
        "In the 19th century new lithographic techniques and the advent of improved presses and smooth paper, led to a revolution in the ability to mass produce images. Balloons remained a common subject of interest to readers, and ready material for satire in the talented hands of artists like Honorè-Victorine Daumier.",
        "Today, the balloon prints produced by 18th and 19th century artists remain as a priceless window into the past. They enable us to share some sense of the excitement that gripped those watching their fellow beings rise into the sky for the first time. Engraved portraits tell us something of the appearance, and even the personality, of the first men and women to fly. Satirical prints utilizing balloon motifs help us to understand the impact that flight on the first generations to experience it.",
        "The National Air and Space Museum owes its collection of balloon prints to the generosity of several leading 20th century collectors. The bulk of the prints in our collection come from Harry Frank Guggenheim (August 23, 1890 - January 22, 1971).. The son of industrialist and philanthropist Daniel Guggenheim and his wife Florence, Harry Guggenheim enjoyed multiple careers as a business leader, diplomat, publisher, philanthropist, and sportsman.",
        "Aviation was the thread that tied his diverse activities together. A graduate of Yale and Pembroke College, Cambridge University, he learned to fly before the U.S. entered WW I and served as a Naval aviator during that conflict and as a Naval officer during WW II. In the mid- 1920's, he convinced his father to establish the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, which had an enormous impact on aeronautical engineering and aviation in the U.S.",
        "A collector of everything from fine art to thoroughbred horses, Guggenheim began to acquire aeronautica during the 1920's, gradually focusing his attention of aeronautical prints. His collection had grown to be one of the most complete in the world by the 1940's, when he loaned his prints to the New York museum maintained by the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences. When the IAS dissolved its museum in the 1950's, Guggenheim donated his own collection to the National Air and Space Museum.",
        "The NASM collection of aeronautical prints also includes items donated by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and by a number of other private collectors, notably Constance Fiske in memory of her husband Gardiner Fiske, who served with the U.S. Army Air Service during WW I and with the USAAF in WWII; Thomas Knowles, a long-time executive with Goodyear Aircraft and Goodyear Aerospace; and Bella Clara Landauer, one of the great American collectors of aeronautica.",
        "There can be little doubt that William Armistead Moale Burden was one of the most significant contributors to the NASM collection of furnishings, ceramics and other objects related to ballooning and the early history of flight. . Burden began collecting aeronautical literature and memorabilia during the 1920's, while still a Harvard undergraduate. Following graduation he rode the post-Lindbergh boom to prosperity as a financial analyst specializing in aviation securities. His business success was inextricably bound to his enthusiasm for the past, present and future of flight.",
        "By 1939, Burden was reputed to have built a personal aeronautical library second only to that of the Library of Congress. He loaned that collection to the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences, an organization that he served as president in 1949. In addition to his library of aeronautica, Burden built a world-class collection of historic objects dating to the late 18th century - desks, chairs, bureaus, sofas, mirrors, clocks, ceramics and other examples of material culture--inspired by the first balloons and featuring balloon motifs. After a period on display in the IAS museum, William A.M. Burden's balloon-decorated furnishings and aeronautica went into insured off-site storage in 1959. A member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, Mr. Burden ultimately donated his treasures to the NASM, as well.",
        "Thanks to the efforts of these and other donors, the NASM can share one of the world's finest collections of works of art and examples of material culture inspired b y the birth of flight with our visitors. We are pleased to extend the reach of our collections to those who visit our web site. Welcome, and enjoy.",

These pasters should be put up about May 15th to 17th with the request that they be left up until May 27th. It is recommended that Red Cross workers attach them to the windows themselves wherever merchants will permit, thus saving the merchant any labor. For attaching to windows use paste - tipping corners only, or use small pieces of gummed paper.",

Her poster has a tan background with the words \"Help Us Help Our Boys\" in red and blue across it. Beneath these words are the YWCA and YMCA emblems joined. The United War Work Campaign was started when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"united their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" These organizations included the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council-Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and the Salvation Army. With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $170, 500,000 for the week of November 11, 1918 (coincidentally the day when World War I ended), which they would then divide pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted. William Haskell Coffin (1878-1941), the artist, was a versatile illustrator who regularly created the covers for Redbook and The American. The distinctive style of his women, later referred to collectively as \"the Coffin girl,\" can be found on note cards, sheet music, calendars, decorative boxes, and fashion catalogs."

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

        "The movie industry, growing out of vaudeville and theatrical traditions that had always used poster advertising, adopted this medium as its primary form of promotion. Charlie Chaplin, one of the most versatile and talented figures of the early film industry, was a successful actor, writer, director, and producer. His screen image-the harassed but gallant Little Tramp who rarely lost his grip on his dignity, his derby, or his cane-had universal appeal. Chaplin's tragicomic persona disguised an astute businessman and a perfectionist filmmaker who is still respected for such classics as Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940). By World War I, Chaplin had already gained international fame for the antics of his Tramp, as indicated in this poster by Danish artist Sven Brasch. Images such as this one transcended language barriers and kept audiences returning for the next Chaplin film."

The war-plane of the future; or, the air-tank.-The sketch is an attempt to show what the war-plane of the near future may be like. Note the triplane and the entirely covered-in fuselage, also the protected \"nacelle\" mounted with quick-firing guns, in addition to a gun on the top of the \"control station,\" for the purpose of engaging craft at a higher altitude. Great lifting capacity (for bomb-carrying) and terrific speed will be the main features. The submarine of the future.-What future developments will take place in the submarine branch of naval warfare is a matter of conjecture. We may possibly yet see craft like that shown in the sketch-enormous submarine cruisers, mounting huge howitzers, the reason being that a very long-range weapon would be useless in a submarine, the craft lying so low in the water that it is impossible to obtain the necessary height required by the gun-fire control.",

        "The Division of Military History and Diplomacy has been collecting recruiting posters for more than fifty years. Recruiting as an activity of the military is important to the understanding of who serves in uniform, during both war and peace, and the visual materials used to market military service. The collection contains examples of early Civil War broadsides, World War I posters, including the original artwork for Uncle Sam as drawn by Montgomery Flagg, and World War II posters, which show the recruiting of men and women for all services and auxiliary organizations. The collection contains primarily Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II recruiting posters for the army, navy and some marines. More modern-day recruiting materials are also contained in the collection, and cover a broad range of army recruiting slogans.",
        "General History",
        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism, and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war."

        "The poster shows a woman holding a plan in her right hand and what looks like a shell in her left. Behind her is a blue YMCA triangle. The right side of the poster has the words “For Every Fighter a Woman Worker” and “United War Work Campaign.” The bottom reads, “Care for Her through The YWCA.” The World YWCA was founded through the convergence of a social activist Lady Mary Jane Kinnaird and the committed Christian Emma Robarts. Mary Jane Kinnaird, born in 1816, was a philanthropist committed to young women’s well being. The YWCA was also active early in the 20th century promoting women's access to healthcare and health education. In 1913 the YWCA debuted a Commission on Social Morality, and the group taught sex education, usually under the names \"social education\" or \"social morality.\" The YWCA promoted frank discussion of sex in order to prepare young women to protect themselves from venereal disease, unwanted pregnancy, and prostitution, and they worked with the War Department during World War I, lecturing on sex education. The artist of this poster, Adolph Treidler was born in Westcliff, Colorado, and studied at the California School of Design. During World War I he designed numerous Liberty Loan and recruiting posters. During World War II he served as Chairman of the Pictorial Publicity Committee for the Society of Illustrators."

        "“Les Foyers du Soldat - Union Franco Americaine” (trans: The Hearths of the Soldier - French American Union). The image shows and American soldier shaking hands with a French soldier. In the background is a YMCA canteen. The YMCA emblem is located at the top of the page. The Union Franco-Americaine was a formal arrangement between the American YMCA and the French Army, and Emmanuel Sautter was in charge of the Foyer du Soldat program. In Februrary 1918, the French ministry of war agreed to provide the YMCA with buildings, tables, benches, light, and heat to establish new foyers. In return, the American YMCA provided secretaries and programming. By February 1919, they had established 1452 Foyers du Soldat for the French army. They operated at the front and behind lines, just as American canteens did. At the conclusion of World War I, supreme allied commander Marshal Foch commented on the massive support that was provided by the YMCA during hostilities in an address to YMCA officials and staff: “Thanks to your powerful help we were able to maintain our morale; thanks to the Foyer du Soldat Union Franco-Americaine YMCA, into which the tired soldier came for new strength, and to find a touch of that family life, or at least that familiar contact which seemed to him an infinite comfort. This was the means by which resistance was maintained [and] you sheltered all that work in the shadow of the finest ideals, the principle of humanity - unselfish service.” A. G. Warshawsky (1883-1962), the artist of the poster, grew up in Cleveland and studied at the Cleveland School of Art. In 1908, he traveled to Paris where he maintained a studio for 30 years. At the outbreak of World War II, he moved to Monterery, California.",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onwards with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp. The original envelope which contained the stamps reads: \"Oorlog-Sluitzegels naar ontwepren van Lodewijk Schelfhout: verpakt onder het merk: Posta: Wittig Gedeponeerd: Serie van 6 stuks 10 cent.",

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

Historical note: 14 July 1789 marks the day that the Parisian mob attacked and captured the Bastille, a fortress used primarily to house political prisoners in the 17th and 18th centuries. This act quickly came to be seen as a symbol for the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the Republic, and it is thus celebrated as Bastille Day, a national holiday, every 14 July.",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

Each city is represented by an object in the image - Philadelphia by a map of its layout, Boston by a whaling ship, and Washington, D.C. by a sextant. The poster also features other elements recalling New England - autumn leaves, a Betsy Ross Flag with needles and thread, and small die cast toys of Revolutionary War soldiers, cannon, and eagle upon a wood background. \"The Historic East\" appears as if carved or burned into an Early American Colonial wood furnishing element. Offset Photolithograph.",
        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development."

Because of two famous advertising campaigns-Uncle Sam's \"I Want You for the U.S. Army\" and Lord Kitchener's \"Your Country Needs You\" in England-the pointing or outstretched hand became a frequent motif for poster propaganda during the war. In addition to that exhorting gesture, Bara used bold coloring and a lively composition of crossing diagonals with the upward-charging horse and the twisting figure. For those who missed the reference to a famous equestrian portrait-Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David-Pershing's recognizable figure was authoritative all on its own."

Two years later he was contributing to Life magazine and at fifteen was on the staff of the The Judge. Flagg studied at the Art Students League in New York. When he was twenty, he spent a year working in London before moving to France. Flagg was one of America's leading illustrators. His illustrations were in Photoplay, McClure's Magazine, Collier's Weekly, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan, Saturday Evening Post, and Harper's Weekly. During the World War I Flagg designed forty-six posters for the government. His most famous work is the Uncle Sam poster with the caption \"I Want You for the U.S. Army.\" An adapted version of this poster was also used during the World War II. Flagg died in 1960.",
        "General History",
        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism, and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war."

        "A United War Work Campaign poster. The top half shows an illustration of a smiling marine with his arms around a soldier and a civilian. Below it says: “keep’em smiling! Help War Camp Community Service.” The bottom left has the “War Camp Community Service” emblem and the text “‘morale is winning the war.’” At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the YMCA, the YWCA, the American Library Association, the War Camp Community Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, and the Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to “better” sources of entertainment, such as movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. They also secured invitations to local homes, thereby allowing soldiers to meet chaperoned girls of high society. Their goal was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases by providing alternative entertainment. Leone M. Bracker, the artist who drew the picture on the poster, was an American visual artist who was born in 1885 and died in 1937. He appears to have illustrated several books such as A Man in the Open (1923) and The Iron Trail (1913). For duplicate - http://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15370coll2/id/2221",

        "In this World War I poster the top half shows soldiers gathering around a YMCA canteen. Most of the image is circumscribed, with some soldiers standing outside, and behind the circle is the red YMCA triangle. Surrounding the image are the words: \"'The Last Evidence that Anybody Cares,' Says a Soldier 'Overthere' of the Y.M.C.A. dugout.\" The bottom half of the poster contains black text against a green background. It has quotes from soldiers endorsing the importance of the Y.M.C.A. in their lives, followed by a plea for donations to support their $35,000,000 campaign. The bottom right explains where donations can be mailed, while the bottom left lists the numbers of Y.M.C.A. War Work Secretaries, where they are serving, and with which nation's soldiers. For a transcription, see \"text.\" Four days after the United States entered World War One on April 6, 1917, state, local and international YMCA organizations met in conference at Garden City, Long Island, to plan for a unified reaction to the war. The first meeting of the National War Work Council was held in New York on April 28, 1917, where President Wilson gave official recognition to the organization. During November 1917, the YMCA announced their goal of $35,000,000. In defense of the amount, John R. Mott, then YMCA General Secretary, wrote: “Some tasks can wait; not this one of serving 24,000,000 men between now and Spring, the most critical period of the war.” Wilson, Taft, and Roosevelt all publicly endorsed the fundraising which, in 2011 USD, would mean raising close to $607,000,000. Three months after they announced the campaign, they passed their goal, and by July 1918 had raised $54,000,000 (just under $936,000,000 2011 USD).",

        "British fundraising poster for Queen Alexandra's Field Force Fund with an image of airplanes dropping supplies to British soldiers who are occupying a battle-scarred landscape. In the foreground, a soldier smoking a pipe leans against the trunk of a decimated tree holding a package marked: a gift from Q.A. F.F.F. In the background, other British troops run to a truck filled with cases of such packages. The text asks for a donation to Queen Alexandra's Field Force Fund \"to provide necessary comforts for the fighting troops.\" Historical note: The hope that providing soldiers with comforts such as cigarettes and wholesome entertainment would keep them pure and untouched by the war is extremely evident in this poster. Whereas the entire town has been destroyed during battle, with trees smashed, buildings wrecked, and the ground transformed into a muddy abyss, the soldiers are depicted as being absolutely fine, with neat uniforms and no blood or dirt on their bodies. Thus, the comforts provided by such charities were viewed as ways to prevent soldiers from succombing to the destruction, terror, and immorality associated with modern warfare. Historical note: This charity is named after Alexandra, queen consort of Edward VII and mother to King George V.",

Recruiting as an activity of the military is important to the understanding of who serves in uniform, during both war and peace, and the visual materials used to market military service. The collection contains examples of early Civil War broadsides, World War I posters, including the original artwork for Uncle Sam as drawn by Montgomery Flagg; and World War II posters, which show the recruiting of men and women for all services and auxiliary organizations. The collection contains primarily Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II recruiting posters for the army, navy and some marines. More modern day recruiting materials are also contained in the collections, and cover a broad range of army recruiting slogans.",

        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism, and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war."

To meet this war emergency, the Fleet Corporation first requisitioned the 431 steel ships being built in American yards for foreign operators, then built three great steel shipyards, plus invested in other shipyards. As posters were a great way to communicate messages of national importance, the Emergency Fleet Corporation employed this means to show its achievements in shipbuilding. The poster shows an eagle leading a fleet of ships in an engulfing wave composed of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. This image was created to reassure a jittery American public about the success of the war effort. It's designer was Joseph Clement Coll (1881 -1921), a prolific magazine illustrator who was one of the earliest to work in the new medium of unengraved drawings.",

        "After Hostels for Soldiers, Hostels for Civilians.\" This poster was made for the Society of the Hearths of the French-American Union by artist Justin Marie Georges Dorival. After World War I, the YMCA continued to offer many forms of assistance to military personnel who had served in Europe. The picture portrays a soldier walking through the wind and rain towards hostels hoisting French and American flags. The YMCA maintained over 1500 canteens in France where service men could eat, sleep, bathe and relax. The organization's workers even provided entertainment as they sought to maintain the body, mind and spirit of the soldiers to whom they ministered. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertizing industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work as \"Geo Dorival.",

But when Batiste Madalena made this hand-painted poster for the film Lilac Time in 1928, the movie industry was experiencing rapid change and growth. The first “talkies,” synchronizing dialogue with moving images, predicted the end of the silent era, and the building of grand “movie palaces” reached a peak, luring new middle-class audiences to feature-length films. In the advertising image for Lilac Time, the artist featured crisp art deco lettering, geometric styling, diving airplanes, and Colleen Moore’s classic bobbed-hair flapper look, even though she plays a curly haired French country girl to Gary Cooper’s World War I aviator."

Although inspired by the British image of a pointing Lord Kitchener, Flagg's version captured the public's imagination with special effectiveness. Along with the stern features of the self-portrait, the foreshortened hand gesture forged a personal connection with the viewer. A generation later, Flagg translated that familiar image into this presidential campaign piece promoting Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented fourth term. The poster coyly avoids asking for votes, suggesting instead that America's duty was to convince the incumbent to run in order to \"finish the job.\" The poster was issued by the Independent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences for Roosevelt, founded in 1944 to promote a fourth term, with the expectation that the president could deliver both victory and a progressive peace settlement."

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

We can hardly see in the new custom a revival of the magical practices of an earlier date, when, to the accompaniment of appropriate incantations, waxen figures were stuck with pins and otherwise maltreated; for in the latter case it was believed that bodily harm was caused to the individual whom the effigy represented. A possible key to the riddle, however, is furnished by a wooden idol in the British Museum\" (the left one of the two shown above). At a hero's resting-place in the firing-line: A French soldier putting flowers on the grave of a comrade buried in the trench-parapet. Association in the perils of war binds close the ties of friendship, and those who fall are not forgotten by their comrades. Whenever possible, their graves are carefully tended, through it is not often that they are so accessible as in this case, where the French soldier's dead comrade lies in the actual parapet of the trenches. Every day a comrade, picking wild-flowers from the crest of the trenches, sets them by the cross in memory of the dead."

In addition to organizing the Industrial Army, the National Service was also in charge of administering British conscription, which began in 1918, and recruiting women to act as clerks on the front and to farm the countryside in the Women's Land Army.",

        "In this World War I poster an older man in a Knights of Columbus uniform gestures at the back of a solider who brings up the end of a line of troops. The group marches toward a horizon marked by clouds from explosions and gunfire. Above the image are the words \"See Him Through,\" while below it reads, \"Help Us To Help The Boys,\" \"National Catholic War Council,\" \"Knights of Columbus,\" and \"United War Work Campaign - Week of November 11-1918.\" Toward the bottom left of the image is the National Catholic War Council emblem, while to the right is the Burton Rice's signature. American Art News (VOL. XVII, No. 7, November 23, 1918), in a critique of then-recent World War I posters, described Rice's poster as \"weakened by too much background of white paper.\" The poster advertises a major fundraising drive that the United War Work Campaign (a coalition of organizations including the Knights of Columbus) underwent. Similar to YMCA work, the Knights of Columbus provided recreation, a place for Catholics to practice their faith, and the amenities of home to soldiers. During World War I, Supreme Knight James A. Flaherty proposed to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The Order raised more than $14 million for this program on its own, and was allocated another $30 million from a national fund drive.

        "\"Painting from The Saturday Evening Post.\"; \"Additional copies may be obtained upon request from the Division of Public Inquiries, Office of War Information, Washington, D.C.\"; \"U.S. Government Printing Office.\"; \"1943-O-511886.\"; The poster depicts a woman in an apron placing a Thanksgiving turkey on the table in front of a standing man at the head of the table, with the faces of extended family members around the table smiling expectantly.; Norman Rockwell was a 20th-century American painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine for more than four decades. The Four Freedoms or Four Essential Human Freedoms is a series of four oil paintings that Rockwell produced in 1943 for reproduction in The Saturday Evening Post alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. Later they were the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Saturday Evening Post and the United States Department of the Treasury. The Four Freedoms theme was derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt in which he identified four essential human rights (Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear) that should be universally protected. The Office of War Information printed four million sets of Four Freedoms posters by the end of the war.; World War II was a massive conflict which involved a majority of the nations of the world, and became the most widespread and deadliest event in human history; it had profound ramifications politically and economically that lasted into the next century. Armed conflict broke out in 1939, resulting primarily from issues and tensions not resolved by World War I, and spurred by desires of expansion; the aggressive Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan, were opposed by the Allies, including France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States, although dozens of countries participated. Gradually, the Allies asserted control, and victory in Europe was declared 8 May 1945, followed by victory over Japan in the Pacific theatre 2 September. In addition to the loss of life among troops, civilian casualties numbered in the millions. Posters were used extensively throughout the war by countries on both sides for purposes such as propaganda, morale, and the broad dissemination of information.; The United States Office of War Information (OWI) was a U.S. government agency created during World War II to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. It coordinated the release of war news for domestic use, and, using posters and radio broadcasts, worked to promote patriotism, warn about foreign spies and recruit women into war work. The office also established an overseas branch, which launched a large scale information and propaganda campaign abroad.; The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. More than a quarter of a billion dollars worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. Norman Rockwell's painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million."

        "In this 1938 poster, sacks and crates of products from \"fascist Spain\" have been stamped with the word \"boycott.\" The swastika serves as a reminder of the ties between fascist Spain and Nazi Germany. The products lie to the side of the railroad tracks as the train appears to be passing them by. The image matches the message of the poster admonishing French railroad workers not to carry products from fascist Spain. The text of the poster is written in French, which places this poster among many others produced by Republican Spain that sought to internationalize the conflict of the Civil War. In particular, the Republican government tried repeatedly to obtain support from the governments of Western liberal democracies, such as Britain and France. In fact, a Non-Intervention Committee was formed at the urging of both Italy and Britain in September 1936. With the ravages of World War I still in recent memory, the goal was to confine the fighting to Spain and to block the sale of weapons to either side of the conflict. Ultimately, the committee failed as Germany and Italy provided much aid and military support to Franco and the Nationalists while Republican Spain received help from the USSR since Britain and France were reluctant to get involved. In this context, this poster appears as an attempt to get France involved in the conflict without necessarily breaking the precedents of the Non-Intervention Committee. Other examples of such attempts by the various groups of Republican Spain to internationalize the Spanish Civil war include posters 65, 80, and 89.",

American Art News (VOL.

Similar to YMCA work, the Knights of Columbus provided recreation, a place for Catholics to practice their faith, and the amenities of home to soldiers. During World War I, Supreme Knight James A. Flaherty proposed to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The Order raised more than $14 million for this program on its own, and was allocated another $30 million from a national fund drive.",

        "Before the first troops could be shipped overseas to fight in the trenches of France during World War I, the American people had to be convinced that the war was both justified and necessary. To sway public opinion, President Woodrow Wilson initiated a massive project to flood the country with powerful propaganda. Americans were called upon to enlist, to buy war bonds, to conserve food and essentials—anything that would help the war effort. This poster, by artist Fred J. Hoertz, reminded shipyard workers that their labor was essential for victory. Like many posters geared towards the manufacturers of war materials, \"Your Work Means Victory\"was meant to show workers that they were just as important as the troops.",
        "Created just days after the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the Committee on Public Information was the independent agency that oversaw the production of various propaganda means, such as newspaper ads, lecturers, and films. But the most effective and wide-reaching method was from the Committee on Pictorial Publicity, which issued the thousands of colorful posters that lined Main Streets across the country. Whether these images were created for a Liberty Bond drive, the Red Cross, or the Department of Labor, every poster urged Americans to do something for \"the boys over there.",

The poster depicts a drawing by Bernard Partridge, titled “Heroic Serbia” (reproduced here by special permission of the proprietors of Punch magazine), that refers to the second big attack on Serbia (1915) by the Central Power forces: Germany and Austria-Hungary from the north and west and Bulgaria, from the east. The author, Sir Bernard Partridge, was one of the finest political cartoonists ever to grace the pages of Punch, a British weekly magazine of humor and satire established in 1841."

Posters and their messages were seen as \"war graphics,\" combining the sophisticated style of contemporary graphic design with the promotion of war aims.",

        "3. The Need to Work - the countless ways in which Americans must work if we are to win the war, in factories, on ships, in mines, in fields, etc.",
        "4. The Need to Fight - the need for fearless waging of war on land, sea, and skies, with bullets, bombs, bare hands, if we are to win.",
        "5. The Need to Sacrifice - Americans are willing to give up all luxuries, devote all spare time to the war effort, etc., to help win the war.",

        "The Division of Military History and Diplomacy has been collecting recruiting posters for more than fifty years. Recruiting as an activity of the military is important to the understanding of who serves in uniform, during both war and peace, and the visual materials used to market military service. The collection contains examples of early Civil War broadsides, World War I posters, including the original artwork for Uncle Sam as drawn by Montgomery Flagg, and World War II posters, which show the recruiting of men and women for all services and auxiliary organizations. The collection contains primarily Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II recruiting posters for the army, navy and some marines. More modern-day recruiting materials are also contained in the collection, and cover a broad range of army recruiting slogans.",
        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism, and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war."

The quotation states that France will press against its heart the sons who have saved her. Behind the banner is a shield and sword surrounded by laurel leaves. The poster also contains the names of two organizations, Les Foyers du Soldat and L'Union Franco-Americaine, located in the upper left and right hand corners. Les Foyers du Soldat was a French organization that provided relief work to soldiers during the war. L'Union Franco-Americaine consisted of a formal arrangement between the French Army and the YMCA. This organization also serviced soldiers. The YMCA maintained over 1500 canteens in France during the war where members of the military could eat, sleep, bathe and relax. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertising industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work as \"Geo Dorival.\" For a duplicate, see http://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15370coll2/id/2100.",

The hospital sister is one of the few who has been the recipient of the King's medal, and, at the military hospital where she works, has nursed hundreds of our pain-wracked heroes back to health. The clenched hands tell their tale as she looks out at the constantly broken circle of life."

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

      "sourceResource.description": "This stamp is one of a complete collection of original [Great] War Poster-Stamps designed by Lodewijk Schelfhout. All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onwards with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp. The original envelope which contained the stamps reads: \"Oorlog-Sluitzegels naar ontwepren van Lodewijk Schelfhout: verpakt onder het merk: Posta: Wittig Gedeponeerd: Serie van 6 stuks 10 cent.",

        "The \"Every Girl Pulling for Victory\" World War I poster depicts a woman wearing a navy uniform rowing a small boat named Victory. Below are the words \"Victory Girls,\" and beneath that, \"United War Work Campaign.\" At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the YMCA, YWCA, American Library Association, War Camp Community Service, Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, and Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to “better” sources of entertainment, such as movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. They also secured invitations to local homes, thereby allowing soldiers to meet chaperoned girls of high society. Their goal was to safeguard soldiers from the twin threats of immorality and venereal disease. During World War I, Victory Girls was an organization through which girls collected pennies, nickels, and dimes to support the war effort. However, by World War II, \"Victory Girls\" (comparable to \"Khaki-Wackies\" and \"Good Time Charlottes\") became slang for women who offered soldiers companionship. The illustrator, Edward Penfield (1866-1925), named the father of the American Poster, was a key figure in the evolution of graphic design and is credited for bringing abstractionism to commercial art. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Penfield studied under the well-known painter George de Forest Brush and ultimately became the art director of Harper's Weekly. After leaving the magazine, Penfield traveled, chronicling his experiences in Holland Sketches (1907) and Spanish Sketches (1911).",

        "British poster advertising the role of the YMCA in British training camps. Illustration depicts two \"Y-Huts\" with British soldiers relaxing, playing ball, smoking pipes, reading newspapers, and conversing with other troops. Whereas the three YMCA signs are higlighted in bright red and white colors, the rest of the poster employs shades of grey and black. Historical note: The Allies made extensive use of Y-Huts in training camps and leave areas in order to promote relaxation and troop morale while keeping soldiers away from vices such as prostitution and alcoholism. Thus, many Y-Huts were equipped with showers, pool tables, reading and game rooms, pianos, phonographs, records, motion picture projectors, office supplies, and athletic equipment and facilities.",

Fortunately, they were almost never used. Nevertheless, almost every country took precautions and produced informational material on poison gases, such as this gas identification poster for blister gases, mustard and lewisite, published here in Maryland for the Artists Civil Defense Project. Mustard gas, or sulfur mustard, is a chemical agent that causes severe burning of the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. It can be absorbed into the body through inhalation, ingestion or by coming into contact with the skin or eyes. Lewisite is an extremely toxic, arsenic-containing blister agent (vesicant) that affects the lungs and causes whole-body (systemic) effects. It has an odor of geraniums.",

        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onward with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp. The original envelope which contained the stamps reads: \"Oorlog-Sluitzegels naar ontwepren van Lodewijk Schelfhout: verpakt onder het merk: Posta: Wittig Gedeponeerd: Serie van 6 stuks 10 cent.",

        "In this World War I poster, the top left corner of the poster has a portrait of President Wilson, behind which is a landscape with a YMCA canteen at the forefront. There are soldiers relaxing in groups around the building, and smoke unfurling from the chimney. Near the top it reads \"Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt and other National Leaders.\" Below is a lengthy appeal for donations, ending with the total amount of money they hope to raise ($35,000,000). In a horizontal banner running along the left edge is a collection of quotes from notable government figures endorsing the fundraising campaign. For a full transcription, see \"Text.\" The United War Work Campaign was started when President Woodrow Wilson suggested the separate American relief organizations \"unite their forthcoming appeals for funds.\" These organizations included the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council-Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp Community Service, American Library Association, and Salvation Army. With the full support of the United States government, they planned to raise a total of $350, 000,000 for the week of November 11-19, in order to support these organizations through the following Spring. They planned to divide the money pro rata according to the percentage each of their seven budgets represented. At the time, this was the biggest drive for funds ever attempted in the United States. Little is known about the illustrator, but this piece fits into a series of similarly text-heavy posters he designed for the United War Work Campaign's fundraiser."

Beneath the image are the words \"Lend Your Strength to the Red Triangle,\" \"Help the 'Y' Help the Fighters Fight,\" and \"United War Work Campaign - November 11 to 18.\" At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the American Library Association, the War Camp Community Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, and the Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. As part of its humanitarian relief work during World War I, the Y.M.C.A. even owned forty-four factories in Europe dedicated to the production of cookies and candy for the troops. This poster was one of many produced by organizations in the United War Work Campaign to advertise their November 11 fundraiser, where they hoped to raise $350,000,000 (at the time, this goal was the most ambitious fundraising in American history). Although little is known about the illustrator, Gil Spear, his son Gil Spear Jr. was a well-known car stylist/designer who designed the distinctive front end on the 1939 Plymouth, 1939 Chrysler New Yorker, and 1940 Chrysler Saratoga.",

        "The Division of Military History and Diplomacy has been collecting recruiting posters for more than fifty years. Recruiting as an activity of the military is important to the understanding of who serves in uniform during both war and peace and the visual materials used to market military service. The collection contains examples of early Civil War broadsides; World War I posters, including the original artwork for Uncle Sam as drawn by Montgomery Flagg; and World War II posters, which show the recruiting of men and women for all services and auxiliary organizations. The collection contains primarily Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II recruiting posters for the army, navy and some marines. More modern-day recruiting materials are also contained in the collection, and cover a broad range of army recruiting slogans.",
        "General History",
        "Posters during World War II were designed to instill in people a positive outlook, a sense of patriotism and confidence. They linked the war in trenches with the war at home. From a practical point, they were used to encourage all Americans to help with the war effort. The posters called on every man, woman, and child to endure the personal sacrifice and domestic adjustments to further the national agenda. They encouraged rationing, conservation, and sacrifice. In addition, the posters were used for recruitment, productivity, and motivation as well as for financing the war effort. The stark, colorful graphic designs elicited strong emotions. The posters played to the fears, frustrations, and faith in freedoms that lingered in people's minds during the war.",

All but one stamp is signed in full by the artist. Each stamp is 7x5 cm. The stamps were designed and sold for the benefit of War-refugees (mainly Belgians) staying in the Netherlands. Lodewijk Schelfhout (1881-1943; painter and master on dry-needle engraving) was a son to the famous ice-scenery painter Andreas Schelfhout. Lodewijk shared a studio in Paris from 1903 onward with Piet Mondriaan, and was strongly influenced by him. Later he turned to cubism and these stamps and his later work are excellent witnesses to this period that lasted almost to the end of his life. His dry-needle engraved oeuvre is massive, always printed in a few copies of very high artistic quality. Along with the stamps, a carte-de-visite sized original card with text printed on verso includes the German translation of the Latin titles printed at head of each stamp. The original envelope which contained the stamps reads: \"Oorlog-Sluitzegels naar ontwepren van Lodewijk Schelfhout: verpakt onder het merk: Posta: Wittig Gedeponeerd: Serie van 6 stuks 10 cent.",

        "A United War Work Campaign poster. The top half shows an illustration of a smiling marine with his arms around a soldier and a civilian. Below it says: “keep’em smiling! Help War Camp Community Service.” The bottom left has the “War Camp Community Service” emblem and the text “‘morale is winning the war.’” At the request of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, the Playground and Recreation Association of America formed the United War Work Campaign, bringing together seven organizations: the YMCA, the YWCA, the American Library Association, the War Camp Community Service, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, and the Salvation Army. They provided soldiers with access to “better” sources of entertainment, such as movies, theaters, libraries and museums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, athletic fields, and clubs. They also secured invitations to local homes, thereby allowing soldiers to meet chaperoned girls of high society. Their goal was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases by providing alternative entertainment. Leone M. Bracker, the artist who drew the picture on the poster, was an American visual artist who was born in 1885 and died in 1937. He appears to have illustrated several books such as A Man in the Open (1923) and The Iron Trail (1913).",

        "The Olympian Hall was built in 1873, and was used for basketball games as well as dances and other events. It was the 2nd and 3rd story of 76-78 Broad Street in the village of Schuylerville. This poster depicts a dance taking place in the Olympian Hall in Schuylerville in 1919. The artist has caricatured and named all the participants. The background is ocher and the figures are colored in black, red, blue etc. The image shows a stage with three musicians (violin, flute and piano) a row of chairs below the stage and another across the bottom of the picture. In between are couples dancing, or small groups talking, or sitting in the chairs. All of the pairings are comical, with a preponderance of large women dancing with smaller men. All of the people all named, and they are all (?) real people. Several of the men are dressed in World War I uniforms. There are comments accompanying some of the people: A man in uniform (not named): “Without Service Chevrons” Woman standing alone named Theresa Hughes: “No Body Dance with me.” Three women chatting with a soldier (all named): Tell us some of your experiences” “It must have been per-fectly won-der-ful.” The artist has included himself, dancing with Frances Hughes. While this poster clearly depicts a scene from 1919, it is not certain that this edition was actually produced in 1919. It is printed on white cardstock and appears very crisp and un-faded. There is tape on the back edges as though it has been taped into a window. The tape is clean and fresh and it is a modern type of “invisible” Scotch tape. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Isadore Sonn was born in Greenwich, New York, in 1876, the son of Michael and Adelaide Sonn. The elder Sonns were immigrants from Germany, who arrived in the United States four years before Isadore was born. Michael had a clothing store in Greenwich, and later opened another in Schuylerville. As an adult, Isadore worked as the bookkeeper in his father’s business. Born deaf, or deafened as a child, Isadore attended a school for the deaf in New York City, which is where he learned to do cartooning. “Isadore was a prolific artist and he gave away a great many pictures which are probably still hidden in local attics. Something special happened to someone, or didn’t happen, and Isadore put his interpretation of it on a penny post card (it was really a penny back then) and dispatched it post haste.” (Greenwich Journal, April 18, 1974). His pictures were displayed in the window of M. Sonn. Later a set of them were hung in the directors’ room of the Greenwich National Bank. The have been exhibited again in 1974, and in 1986. Isadore Sonn died of pneumonia in Greenwich, on 7 December 1933"

Les Foyers du Soldat was a French organization that provided relief work to soldiers during the war. L'Union Franco-Americaine consisted of a formal arrangement between the French Army and the YMCA. The YMCA also provided services to soldiers; the organization maintained over 1500 hostels where members of the military could eat, sleep, bathe and relax. This poster provides an example of the notices printed for the YMCA at this time. The poster is blank in the center and the space was or may have been used as a sign-up sheet for members of YMCA participating for a certain event. In the picture, the organization's emblem at the top is surrounded by different types of sports equipment. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertizing industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he signed his work as \"Geo Dorival."

The image is a reproduction of the signatures on the treaty, including Palmerston of Great Britain, Sylvain van de Weyer of Belgium, Senfft of Austria, H.

The text states the terms of the agreement and poses the question, \"Can Britons stand by while Germany crushes an innocent people?\" Historical note: British propaganda during the first year of World War I capitalized on the notion of defending the small and helpless Belgian nation from German aggression despite the fact that British war planners were generally more concerned with keeping ports on the English Channel out of enemy hands.",

        "A World War I poster designed to be placed in soldiers' canteens during World War I in France. It contains two medallions which represent older and younger women. The text advises men to think of their mothers, sisters, and fiancees before saying foolish things when talking about women. Directly translated, the poster says, \"When you speak about a woman, think of your mother, think of your sister, think of your fiance and you will not say silly things.\" The medallions are linked by a floral motif and French and American flags. The poster also contains the names of two organizations, Les Foyers du Soldat and l'Union Franco-Americaine, located in the upper left and right hand corners. Les Foyers du Soldat was a French organization that provided relief services to soldiers during the war. l'Union Franco-Americaine consisted of a formal arrangement between the French army and the YMCA. This organization also serviced soldiers. The YMCA maintained over 1500 canteens in France during the war where members of the military could eat, sleep, bathe and relax. The artist, Justin Marie Georges Dorival, had trained in Paris at the National School of Decorative Arts. Before the war, he garnered increasing fame as a poster artist for tourism and advertizing industries. During World War I, Dorival designed posters for the French Red Cross and the Women's Union of France. He also created war time posters for organizations in the United States, such as the YMCA. Throughout his career as a graphic artist, he would sign his work as 'Geo Dorival."

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

Below the image are the words: \"Back our girls over there\" and \"United War Work Campaign,\" along with the Y.W.C.A. emblem. The United War Work Campaign was a combined effort of several organizations, including the Y.W.C.A., to raise money for the war. As the only women's organization in the Campaign, the YWCA's mission was to meet the special needs of women and girls affected by the war. They raised money, recruited war workers, expanded their work in places which already had YWCAs (or \"blue triangle houses\"), and constructed new facilities in other places. Their facilities included camps for soldiers and centers where young women were mobilized for agricultural, industrial, and government work. The illustrator, Clarence Frederick Underwood (1871-1929), was born in Jamestown, New York, and studied at the Art Students League as well as the Academy of Julian in Paris. He illustrated for the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' World, and other magazines. He was on the staff of the New York Press and died of cerebral hemorrhaging.",

        "Fly Now: The National Air and Space Museum Poster Collection",
        "Throughout their history, posters have been a significant means of mass communication, often with striking visual effect. Wendy Wick Reaves, the Smithsonian Portrait Gallery Curator of Prints and Drawings, comments that \"sometimes a pictorial poster is a decorative masterpiece-something I can't walk by without a jolt of aesthetic pleasure. Another might strike me as extremely clever advertising … But collectively, these 'pictures of persuasion,' as we might call them, offer a wealth of art, history, design, and popular culture for us to understand. The poster is a familiar part of our world, and we intuitively understand its role as propaganda, promotion, announcement, or advertisement.",
        "Reaves' observations are especially relevant for the impressive array of aviation posters in the National Air and Space Museum's 1300+ artifact collection. Quite possibly the largest publicly-held collection of its kind in the United States, the National Air and Space Museum's posters focus primarily on advertising for aviation-related products and activities. Among other areas, the collection includes 19th-century ballooning exhibition posters, early 20th-century airplane exhibition and meet posters, and twentieth-century airline advertisements.",
        "The posters in the collection represent printing technologies that include original lithography, silkscreen, photolithography, and computer-generated imagery. The collection is significant both for its aesthetic value and because it is a unique representation of the cultural, commercial and military history of aviation. The collection represents an intense interest in flight, both public and private, during a significant period of its technological and social development.",

Both were responsible for laying of the North Sea Mine Barrage against German submarines in 1918.
